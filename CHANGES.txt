3.5.0 (2008-12-30)
------------------

- Remove zope.testing from dependencies, as it's not really needed.

- Define IIndexSort interface for indexes that support sorting.

- Implement sorting for FieldIndex (adapted from repoze.catalog/ZCatalog).

- Add an ``apply`` method for KeywordIndex/TopicIndex, making them
  implement IIndexSearch that can be useful in catalog.

- Optimize the ``search`` method of KeywordIndex/TopicIndex by using
  multiunion for the ``or`` operator and sorting before intersection for ``and``.

- IMPORTANT: KeywordIndex/TopicIndex now use IFSets instead of IISets.
  This makes it more compatible with other indexes (for example, when
  using in catalog). This change can lead to problems, if your code somehow
  depends on the II nature of sets, as it was before.
  
  Also, FilteredSets used to use IFSets as well, if you have any
  FilteredSets pickled in the database, you need to migrate them to
  IFSets yourself. You can do it like that:
  
      filter._ids = filter.family.IF.Set(filter._ids)
  
  Where ``filter`` is an instance of FilteredSet.

- IMPORTANT: KeywordIndex are now non-normalizing. Because
  it can be useful for non-string keywords, where case-normalizing
  doesn't make any sense. Instead, it provides the ``normalize``
  method that can be overriden by subclasses to provide some
  normalization.
  
  The CaseInsensitiveKeywordIndex class is now provided that
  do case-normalization for string-based keywords. The old
  CaseSensitiveKeywordIndex is gone, applications should use
  KeywordIndex for that.

Looks like the KeywordIndex/TopicIndex was sort of abadonware
and wasn't used by application developers, so after some
discussion we decided to refactor them to make them more
usable, optimal and compatible with other indexes and catalog.

Porting application from old KeywordIndex/TopicIndex to new
ones are rather easy and explained above, so we believe that
it isn't a problem. Please, use zope3-users@zope.org or
zope-dev@zope.org mailing lists, if you have any problems
with migration.

Thanks Chris McDonough of repoze for supporting and useful code.
